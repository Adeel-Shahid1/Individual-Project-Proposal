    "### Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "To measure extraversion and a desire for social interactions I may use:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1. PSYCH_big_five_inventory_talks - I see myself as someone who talks a lot\n",
    "\n",
    "Relevance: This directly measures a key trait of extraversion, as extroverts are typically more talkative.\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualisation: Bar chart to show the frequency of each reponse and the degree to which they agree of disagree. It is a simple and easy way to understand the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2. CONNECTION_social_barriers_no_troubles - No social barriers\n",
    "\n",
    "Relevance: The absence of barriers to social interaction can be associated with higher levels of extraversion and a desire for social interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualisation: This is like YES/NO question and a pie chart can illustrate the population with no social barriers, and those who have not selected in a simple way.\n",
    "##### 3. CONNECTION_comfort_talking_with_strangers - How comfortable are you talking with strangers?\n",
    "\n",
    "Relevance: Comfort in talking with strangers is a strong indicator of extraversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualisation: A histogram can show the distribution of comfort levels when talking with strangers, ranging from very uncomfortable to very comfortable, in a way that is easy to read.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 4. CONNECTION_social_barriers_introvert - I am an introvert \n",
    "\n",
    "Relevance: Lower scores on this variable would suggest higher extraversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualisation: This is like YES/NO question and a pie chart can illustrate the population with no social barriers, and those who have not selected in a simple way.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have listed these variables since they can help reflect whether an individual is extroverted or not. An extrovert would likely see themselves as people who talk a lot, can comfortably talk to strangers and are not introverted. Some may be more important than others.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above variables can be seen as independent, affecting the dependent variable below.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### WELLNESS_life_satisfaction - How do you feel about your life as a whole right now?\n",
    "\n",
    "Relevance: Can measure life satisfaction and a correlation between extraversion and low/high life satisfaction\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualisation: A box plot can display the range, median, and quartiles of life satisfaction scores to highlight the overall distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "It can also be useful to create a histogram of Life Satisfaction scores or any of the variables to understand its distribution.\n"

    "### Analysis Method\n",
    "\n",
    "For this research question, I will be using the chi-square test  to determine if there is an association between extraversion and life satisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Define Hypothesis\n",
    "Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no association between extraversion/social interaction and life satisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternative Hypothesis (H1): There is an association between extraversion/social interaction and life satisfaction\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the data is already categorized, a contingency table can then be made.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Create a contingency table\n",
    "For each independent variable (e.g., PSYCH_big_five_inventory_talks), create a contingency table with WELLNESS_life_satisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Calculate the expected frequencies, compute the Chi-Squared Statistic and determine the degrees of freedom\n",
    "For each cell in the contingency table, calculate the expected frequency assuming no association between the variables. Then, compute the Chi-Squared Statistic and find the degrees of freedom.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Compare the Chi-Squared Statistic to the Critical Value:\n",
    "Compare the calculated Chi-Squared statistic to the critical value from the Chi-Squared distribution table at the desired significance level (e.g., 0.05). If the Chi-Squared statistic is greater than the critical value, we reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "From this we can learn if there is a significant association between the independent variables and life satisfaction. This can inform us about the relationship between extraversion, social interactions, and life satisfaction\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Assumptions\n",
    "The expected frequency for each cell in the contingency table should be at least 5. This assumption is essential for the chi-square test to be valid because low frequencies can make the test inaccurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each observation or data point should be independent of other and each subject or case should only contribute to one cell in the contingency table.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"independent\" variables are actually independent, and the \"dependent\" variables are dependent."
